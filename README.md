# ![The Forge Logo](Screenshots/TheForge-on-white.jpg)

This is a derivative of ConfettiFX The Forge, this version has a pure C interface andjust the renderer portion and uses CMake and my own al2o3 framework for some parts (TODO reduce dependency).

The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1 and RTX Ray Tracing API
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS / iOS / iPad OS with Metal 2.2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 / PS4 Pro (only available for accredited developers on request)
- Switch (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)
- Google Stadia (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, the graphics layer of The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded and asynchronous resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

The Forge can be used to provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines. It is also meant to provide building blocks to write your own game engine. It is like a "lego" set that allows you to use pieces to build a game engine quickly. The "lego" High-Level Features supported on all platforms are at the moment:
- Asynchronous Resource loading with a resource loader task system as shown in 10_PixelProjectedReflections
- Consistent Memory Managament: 
  * on GPU following [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
  * on CPU [Fluid Studios Memory Manager](http://www.paulnettle.com/)
